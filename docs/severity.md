# Severity of Issues

The severity levels for issues are as follows:

* Severity 1

  * **Critical Impact**. This indicates you are unable to use the AWS Private Certificate Authority(PCA) Issuer Plugin resulting in a critical impact on operations. This condition requires an immediate solution.
  * The PCA Issuer Plugin is unable to operate or has caused other critical software to fail and there is no acceptable way to work around the problem.

* Severity 2

    * **Significant Impact**. This indicates the  PCA Issuer Plugin is usable but is severely limited.
    * Severely limited can mean that a supported workflow (<Link to README w/ supported workflow>) is unable to operate, the supported workflow causes other critical software to fail, or the supported workflow is usable but not without severe difficulty.
    * This can also mean that functionality which you were attempting to use failed, but a temporary work-around is available.
    * Documentation that causes the customer to perform some operation which damages data (unintentional deletion, corruption, etc.).
    * Data integrity problems. This can include cases where customer data is inaccurately stored, or retrieved. 

* Severity 3

    * **Some Impact.** This indicates the PCA Issuer Plugin is usable but a supported workflow runs with minor issues/limitations.
    * The supported workflow that you were attempting to use behaved in a manner which is incorrect and/or unexpected, or presented misleading or confusing information.
    * This can include poor or unexplained log messages where no clear error was evident.
    * This can include situations where some side effect is observed which does not significantly harm operations.

* Severity 4

    * **Minimal impact.** This indicates the problem causes little impact on operations or that a reasonable circumvention to the problem has been implemented.
    * This can include documentation which was incomplete or incorrect.
    * The function you were attempting to use suffers from usability quirks, requires minor documentation updates, or could be enhance with some minor changes to the function.
    * This is also the place for general Help/DOC suggestions where data is NOT missing or incorrect.
