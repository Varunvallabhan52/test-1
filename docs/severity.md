# Severity of Issues

The severity levels for issues are as follows:

* Severity 1
  * Critical customer/product impact. This indicates you are unable to use the overall product resulting in a critical impact on operations. This condition requires an immediate solution.
  * The product is unable to operate or the product caused other critical software to fail and there is no acceptable way to work around the problem.

* Severity 2
  * Significant customer/product impact. This indicates the product is usable but is severely limited.
  * Severely limited can mean that a task is unable to operate, the task caused other critical software to fail, or the task is usable but not without severe difficulty.
  * A serious performance degradation might fall into this category unless it was so bad as to render the system completely inoperative.
  * This can mean that function which you were attempting to use failed to function, but a temporary work-around is available.

* Severity 3
  * Some product impact. This indicates the program is usable but a task runs with minor issues/limitations.
  * The task that you were attempting to use behaved in a manner which is incorrect and/or unexpected, or presented misleading or confusing information.
  * This can include documentation which was incomplete or incorrect, making it difficult to know how to use a task.
  * This can include poor or unexplained log messages where no clear error was evident.
  * This can include situations where some side effect is observed which does not significantly harm operations.
  * Documentation that causes the customer to perform some operation which damaged data (unintentional deletion, corruption, etc.) would more likely be listed as a severity 2 problem.
  * This can not include cases where customer data is inaccurately stored, or retrieved. Data integrity problems require a severity of 2 or higher.

* Severity 4
  * Minimal product impact. This indicates the problem causes little impact on operations or that a reasonable circumvention to the problem has been implemented.
  * The function you were attempting to use suffers from usability quirks, requires minor documentation updates, or could be enhance with some minor changes to the function.
  * This is also the place for general Help/DOC suggestions where data is NOT missing or incorrect.
